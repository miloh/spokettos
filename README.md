Spokettos
=========
scad designs for spoke attachements

two design methods:
- provide dxf outline, import into scad by edting spokettos.scad, and merge the
spoketto base to the linearly extruded outlines 
  - dxf files can be generated from svg by following a good howto available at: [instructions](http://repraprip.blogspot.com/2011/05/inkscape-to-openscad-dxf-tutorial.html) note on building and exporting in inkscape: when building hand cobbled images for spokettos, the document size may offset the placement location design select file>document properties and in the page size section of the document properties dialog, choose 'resize page to drawing or selection'. proceed to export dxf files normally.
- provide csfg content to attach to the spoketto base

note on importing: dxfs imported to openscad should have straight line paths
only, when importing dxf, a 'spline' error indicates there is some hidden
spline/svg objects in the dxf that got exported
